Monero cryptocurrency parser.

## Notes on Testing

- unit tests are located in `test/unit_tests`
- to build and run the tests, run `make test` in the _root_ of the project
- there is a Makefile in `test` dir as well
  - but no need to use it directly (it is called from the main Makefile)
  - this one just needs to be editted when a new test is created
