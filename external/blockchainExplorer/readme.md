1. Install the monero from source. 
	* It suffices to follow first two steps (i.e. Dependencies and compilation) from this tutorial: [https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04)
	* Careful! One must install the specific version, in exact: `git checkout -b last_release v0.11.1.0`. This fact is not mentioned in the tutorial above.
2. Download the source I've provided
3. install it via cmake
	* mkdir build && cd build
	* cmake ..

4. Check whether you have correct paths to your blockchain
5. Profit
